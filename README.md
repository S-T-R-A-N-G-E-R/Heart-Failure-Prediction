# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and logistic regression modeling.

## Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: 
    git clone https://github.com/S-T-R-A-N-G-E-R/Heart-Failure-Prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Heart Failure Notebook.ipynb` for detailed steps and code.

## Results
- We were able to successfully impute the missing data in columns "Cholesterol" and "RestingBP"
- Our logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 86.3% in predicting heart disease.
